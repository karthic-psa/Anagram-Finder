# Anagram Finder #

## Overview and Requirements: ## 
An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema , formed from iceman. This program is used to parse through a text file and find anagrams for the specific word given by the user.

1. In each case, the program should accept a single parameter which will be the name of the dictionary file. The dictionary file consists of a list of words. Each word is on separate line.
2. The program should provide a command line prompt where a user can input a word of their choice. On hitting enter the program should find all anagrams, if any exist, of the word and print them out on the next line as a comma separated list. If no anagrams are found it should print out “No anagrams found for <word>”.
3. Include in the output timings for loading the dictionary and timings for each anagram set request.
4. The program should continue to prompt for anagrams until “exit” is typed at the prompt.

## Dependencies for Project: ##

1. Java (jdk) - Make sure Java is installed on your machine.

## How to Run: ##

1. Clone the repo or download the zip and extract the files.

2. Open Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal in Linux and cd (go) to your project directory.

3. Compile the ```anagrams.java``` file using the command  ```javac anagrams.java``` (This will create the ```classname.class``` CLASS File that is needed to run the program).

4. Run the program by ```java anagrams (yourfilename).txt```

5. If you are adding new text (dictionary) files to test, please add them in the same directory as your ```anagrams.java``` file.

### Time Taken to Complete Task: ###

The total time to complete project was about 5 hours. Spent about 2 hours for two days. Took a bit of time to optimize the code to ensure efficiency and also to go through a bit of documentation.
